After a duration from learning programming language of caurse this duration change from one to other but it's end by asking our self few questions like:

* What is the best way to write the code ?
* How I can make my code look better?

and more questions specially for people who try to start contribute on **Open Source**, or people working in project with seniors developers.

So today I would like to share with you what I read about **Defensive Programming**; a way to make our code more better and not even that but help our team to understand the code and specially to not break it ðŸ˜…, and most time this happen if you are teaming with juniors, in this case the code review take more time and we could have lot of back and forth, and here we need to make our code readable, understandable, extendable and can prevent bugs.

This is the **part 1** of the **Defensive Programming: Rules and Techniques** series.

_Level: **intermediate**_

### Prerequisites

### Introduction

This topic is subjective because it's depend on Programming Loangage, the context and Framework, so we can say this presentation will be an introduction for this approach
