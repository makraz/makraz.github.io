One of the most questions people ask me is, what IDE, theme, font, etc I use. So I decided to write up a little post about the tools I use. This page is inspired by Wes Bos' uses page.

## Editor + Terminal

- Sublime Text V3 was the first editor that I used for web development; I still use it for some of my projects (I use it to create this website).
  - Theme: [Agila Neon Theme](https://github.com/arvi/Agila-Theme#agila-neon-theme)
  - Color Schema: [Agila Monokai Extended](https://github.com/arvi/Agila-Theme/blob/master/Agila%20Monokai%20Extended.tmTheme)
  - Font: [Consolas](http://www.fontpalace.com/font-details/Consolas/)
- PHPStorm is my current editor, which I use since 2016 after 2 years of Sublime Text.
  - Theme: [Darcula Darker Theme](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12692-darcula-darker-theme)
  - Color Schema: [Darcula](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12692-darcula-darker-theme)

## Desktop Apps

- I use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) for search and workflows.
- I use [Better Touch Tool](https://setapp.com/apps/bettertouchtool) for window management, custom keyboard shortcuts and a few other things.
- I use [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) to record and edit my screencasts.
- I'm a fan of [Lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html), I use it to take my screenshots.
- My mic is a [ATR2500x-USB](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2500x-USB-Condenser-Microphone-ATR/dp/B07ZPC2FMQ) with a [K & M Pop Killer](https://www.amazon.com/K-M-23956-000-55-Pop-Killer/dp/B000NGVQT0).

## Backup Strategy

I'm still improving my Backup strategy, however I use the following:

- I backup my entire computer locally to a Time Machine on a [G-DRIVE Mobile SSD](https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/portable-drives/g-technology-g-drive-mobile-usb-3-1-ssd)
- I still use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) for backuping a some files.
